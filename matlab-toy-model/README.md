# Toy model in Matlab
Matlab implementation of the toy model (Andrieu, 2010)
with `sigma_x=10.0` and `sigma_y=1.0`.

## To run
Running the script "simulate" will produce results for a run of M=10000 MCMC steps with N=500 particles for particle Gibbs, marginalized particle Gibbs, particle Gibbs with ancestor sampling and marginalized particle Gibbs with ancestor sampling. All parameters are set to the same values as in section 3.2 in the paper.
