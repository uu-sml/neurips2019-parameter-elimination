# Code for the experiments in the paper "Parameter elimination in particle Gibbs sampling"
This repository contains the code for all experiments in the paper.
 - The toy model (section 3.2) is available both in Birch (`birch-toy-model`) and in Matlab (`matlab-toy-model`).
 - The code for blocking (section 4.1) is available only in Matlab (`matlab-toy-model-blocking`).
 - The code for the vector-borne disease dataset (section 4.2) and the code for the ecology model (section 4.3) are available only in Birch (`birch-vector-borne-disease` and `birch-ecological model`).

Details on how to run each example are provided in the corresponding subrepositories.
